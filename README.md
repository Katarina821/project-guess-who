# Guess who-project

The assigment for this project was to build a Guess Who-game using objects and arrays to store info about the charachters in the game, and to filter the board according to the players questions.

## The problem

In this project i found it most difficult how how to pass the right arguments to to nextcoming function, i understood it better by "trial and error". I used sweetalert to replace the wimndows alert function, howevere i couldnÂ´t make it work for the confirmboxes, if i would have had more time i would have worked on that.
