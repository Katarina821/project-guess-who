# Guess who-project

The assigment for this project was to build a Guess Who-game using objects and arrays to store info about the charachters in the game, and to filter the board according to the players questions.

## The problem

In this project i found it most difficult know how to pass the right arguments to to nextcoming function. If i would have had more time I would have trie to add a counterfunction.
